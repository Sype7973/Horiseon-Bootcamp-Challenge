# <Horiseon Clean and Access>

## Description

- The motivation for this project was updating the Horiseon website to be more accessible to avoid any litigation based on unaccessible elements on the website. 
- Also to improve website backend including HTML semantics and classifications
- Inaccessibility and modifies code to be easier to understand by future devs
- I learn't that parts of the code may operate but not to its full function and that without comments in code some of these bugs can be harder to identify
